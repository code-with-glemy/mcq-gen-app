nder the control of Manamadurai Municipalilty, situated on the border betwe=
en Madurai and Sivagangai districts, in Tamil Nadu, India. The Keezhadi exc=
avation site is located in this area. excavations carried out by the Archae=
ological Survey of India (ASI) and the Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department (T=
NAD) have revealed a Sangam era settlement dated to the 6th century BCE by =
radiocarbon dating.[1] Claims that the results show that there was writing =
at that time have been challenged. It is not clear whether the potsherds co=
ntaining inscriptions were found in the same archaeological layer as the 6t=
h century samples, and University of Calcutta archaeologist Bishnupriya Bas=
ak said that "This unfortunately is not clear from the report and is very c=
rucial", adding that the issues of "layer, period and absolute dates" neede=
d clarity. Dravidian University archaeologist E. Harsha Vardhan said that a=
 single report was not enough to "state scientifically that the Tamil-Brahm=
i script belongs to the sixth century BC".[2]
